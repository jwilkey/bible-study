      endurance: `What did the church in Christ have to endure? Born out of the spiritual longing and dryness of the pharisaical rule. Born out of the irritating overrule of the Roman Empire. Born a strange delight into a schismatic world. Born an un-ignorable child at the political table of darkened men. Why did the world care to harm them? Because the world is led by Satan, Christ's enemy, Christ's conquest! Oh martyrs who love and give mercy and grace, would not the world have seen that you would bless them! But their father, the devil, whispered schemes into their ears that became arrows hurled at your hearts. Nevertheless, we endure the folly and violence of this world patiently, because we are patient in Jesus! Patient even for all that is yet to be spoken in this book.`,
      'like a son of man': `Jesus! For the first readers of this book: we have not seen you or heard from you directly since you ascended after your resurrection. What do you look like now? What are you doing? Where, exactly, are you?! Your hair is white like snow! You always have been so pure and good! A golden sash, how regal, how honorable! Such determination and passion in His eyes, with such fierceness as He sees what we endure! There He stands in the strength and awe of rich metal. When He speaks it is as if there is nothing else to hear, with such power He utters grace. A star once revealed the meekness of His arrival amongst us, now He clutches the stars in the palm of His hand like trinkets. He, the word manifest, speaks the word decisively effectual. He is complete light unto our humbling darkness, and His light smiles upon us!`,
      fell: `There have been many things that have fallen, and this book will tell of many wondrous falls. Yet there is sweet sustenance for those who fall for the sake of the glory of Christ. For them there is peace and glorification. Jesus places His hand on the fallen saint to say "Fear not". Jesus is life to His people. But those who fall before the two-edged sword of His justice will not rise again.`,
      forevermore: `The Scriptures, the book of things that are forever. Jesus, the God of life forever.`

      sincerity: 'John was writing from a heart of relating to the churches in their tribulation and fragile circumstances.',
      awe: `John was quaked in his deepest self by the splendor of Jesus, so much that his legs gave out, indeed his whole self gave out as if he were dead. "Amazed" would be too shallow an expression for how he seems to have felt at the sight of Christ's glory. "Impressed" would overly restrict his experience to a mere intellectual level. "Baffled" would undermine the realness of the things he beheld. "Thrilled" would neglect the gravity and good danger of the scene of this King whose mouth protrudes a two-edged sword, whose feet are beautified as something which withstands a hot furnace. John was in awe and was overcome at the splendor of Jesus.`,
      fear: `John had fear at the sight of Jesus, the kind of fear like when one stands in front of something enormous, dangerous, insurmountable and yet totally good. Thank Jesus that His goodness and love causes Him to tenderly relieve us of our rightful fear.`
