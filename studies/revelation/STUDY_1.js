      witness: 'Those who have seen and those who will see have the honor and responsibility to give witness to these things. Jesus bore witness to the glory of God and to the things that would soon happen to the church. John bore witness to the life of Christ and to the message delivered to him that he was responsible to pass along to the churches. Various angelic servants of God bear witness to His holiness and actions toward mankind. We, the church, receive all these things and re-proclaim them aloud so that others may receive them henceforth.',
      'who is, who was, who is to come': `God is constant, not in the sense that he does always the same things in the way that a machine performs methodically the limited tasks for which it was designed. God is the great designer of all mechanisms, yet He is purely faithful, enduring into time past, time future, and the fullness of the present moment. At no point does He cease to be who He is. At no point does He deviate or change from who He is. The winds and waters of mankind's grinding changes may cascade over God's creation, yet the Creator is not weathered or worn. He is constant, He is faithful.`,
      freed: `The Law reveals bondage to the effects of justice upon our many transgressions. The world and our neighbor would have us pinned beneath the guilt of our sinful nature, denying all the while that by revealing our sin they are revealing that reality which they too share -- enslavement to inadequacy, inability, ineptitude, and willful disobedience. We, from birth, are the enemies of God and the slaves of sin and the Deceiver. But life is in the blood, and the righteous blood of Jesus was given in express payment for our lives, purchasing our undeniable freedom. Whatever charge is brought against God's elect has been atoned. There is none to condemn, for the lamb has died. The lion roars his rebuke to silence the feeble rebuke of any who would arrogantly bring their charge. They say, "here is my complaint," and He responds, "here is my blood!"`,
      kingdom: `A place of safety and belonging. A place for living and doing. A place where one reigns. Praise be to the Lord who is worthy to reign. Thanks be to Him for the brothers and sisters whom He has drawn in.`
