 1˚Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ˙
     has been born of God,˙
   and everyone who loves the Father˙
     loves whoever has been born of him.˙
 2˚By this we know that we love the children of God,˙
     when we love God and obey his commandments.˙
 3˚For this is the love of God,˙
     that we keep his commandments.˙
 ˙
   And his commandments are not burdensome.˙
 ˙
 4˚For everyone who has been born of God˙
     overcomes the world.˙
   And this is the victory that has overcome the world—˙
     our faith.˙
 5˚Who is it that overcomes the world˙
     except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
 
 6˚This is he who came by water and blood—˙
     Jesus Christ;˙
   not by the water only˙
     but by the water and the blood.˙
   And the Spirit is the one who testifies,˙
     because the Spirit is the truth.˙
 7˚For there are three that testify:˙
   8˚the Spirit and the water and the blood;˙
     and these three agree.˙
 9˚If we receive the testimony of men,˙
     the testimony of God is greater,˙
     for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son.˙
10˚Whoever believes in the Son of God˙
     has the testimony in himself.˙
   Whoever does not believe God˙
     has made him a liar,˙
     because he has not believed in the testimony˙
       that God has borne˙
       concerning his Son.˙
11˚And this is the testimony,˙
     that God gave us eternal life,˙
     and this life is in his Son.˙
12˚Whoever has the Son˙
     has life;˙
   whoever does not have the Son of God˙
     does not have life.
