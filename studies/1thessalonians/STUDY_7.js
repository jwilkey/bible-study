For all their suffering, all their travels, all their sacrifice of material comfort and personal success, the Thessalonians were the fruit of their eternal and spiritual success. The faith of the Thessalonians was the glory of Paul, God's servant.`,
      establish: `Paul wanted to be sure that the Thessalonians were well cared for, nurtured and tended to during their persecution. Like a plant facing untimely frost or fierce wind and drought, the Thessalonians needed special protection, mending and care. So he sent Timothy.`,
      affliction: `Satan has many weapons in this spiritual battle, and in the case of the Thessalonian church he chose to employ affliction and the doubts, weariness and tears that accompany it. Would the Thessalonians hang on or would they give up and decide it wasn't worth the very present trouble they were facing. Would the tempter swoop in and devour the seed? Would the heat of the sun scorch the young church? Would the thorns of the cares of this world choke them? It appears not. God is faithful, may He be glorified!`

        comment: `And sometimes the shadows settle over your soul like a dungeon you've made your own home, cold and bitter and guilty. God would have us use our hands to work and labor unto health and peace, but by avengin ourselves unduly against another image bearer, and certainly not for some temporal gain that is dry, dead grass in comparison to the hope and joy of the eternal kingdom of God.`,

It is true that the fruit of a Christian is their real blessing and influence on others unto salvation and discipleship in Christ; but even if all should despise us we are still valued in the sight of our King and Father. If I like a tree fall in a remote forest, and no one hears me, my faithful end still sounds forth in solemn pleasure to my God.`,
