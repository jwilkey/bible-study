Love and passion is such a rich amber glass intoxicating it's selfish, foolish consumer, subduing them in impotent slavery to base gratification, to secret indulgence. Guilt, hiding, enchantment. So many men and women like finger toys in the hands of demons! Oppositely, for husband and wife, the secret garden, the rich fragrance of love, the anointing oils, a place of restoration and rejoicing; a place of pleasure without the slightest hint of shame or guilt. One pure man, one pure women in covenant uniting in selfless celebration.`,
