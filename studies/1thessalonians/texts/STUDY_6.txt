13˚And we also thank God constantly for this,
     that when you received the word of God,
         which you heard from us,
               you accepted it
                   not as the word of men
                   but as what it really is,
                          the word of God,
         which is at work in you believers.
14˚For you,
       brothers,
       became imitators of the churches of God
                           in Christ Jesus
                           that are in Judea.
   For you
       suffered the same things
         from your own countrymen
         as they did from the Jews,
         15˚who killed both the Lord Jesus
                            and the prophets,
            and drove us out,
            and displease God
            and oppose all mankind
             16˚by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles
                                that they might be saved—
            so as always to fill up the measure of their sins.
            But wrath has come upon them at last!
