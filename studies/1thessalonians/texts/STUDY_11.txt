13 But we do not want you to be uninformed,
     brothers,
     about those who are asleep,
     that you may not grieve as others do
       who have no hope.
14 For since we believe that Jesus died
       and rose again,
     even so,
       through Jesus,
     God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.
15 For this we declare to you
       by a word from the Lord,
     that we who are alive,
     who are left
       until the coming of the Lord,
     will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
16 For the Lord himself will descend
       from heaven
     with a cry of command,
     with the voice of an archangel,
     and with the sound of the trumpet of God.
     And the dead in Christ will rise first.
  17 Then we who are alive,
       who are left,
     will be caught up together with them
       in the clouds
     to meet the Lord in the air,
     and so we will always be with the Lord.
18 Therefore encourage one another
     with these words.
