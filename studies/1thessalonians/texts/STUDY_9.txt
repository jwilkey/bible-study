1˚Finally, then,
  brothers,
    we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus,
      that as you received from us how you ought to walk
        and to please God,
        just as you are doing,
      that you do so more and more.
2˚For you know what instructions we gave you
    through the Lord Jesus.
  3˚For this is the will of God,
      your sanctification:
      that you abstain from sexual immorality;
    4˚that each one of you know how to control his own body
        in holiness
        and honor,
    5˚not in the passion of lust
        like the Gentiles
        who do not know God;
    6˚that no one transgress
              and wrong
        his brother in this matter,
      because the Lord is an avenger in all these things,
        as we told you beforehand
        and solemnly warned you.
7˚For God has not called us for impurity,
    but in holiness.
8˚Therefore whoever disregards this,
    disregards not man but God,
    who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
