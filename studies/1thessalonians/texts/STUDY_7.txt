17˚But since we were torn away from you, brothers,
     for a short time,
     in person not in heart,
     we endeavored the more eagerly
       and with great desire
     to see you face to face,
  18˚because we wanted to come to you—
       I, Paul, again and again—
     but Satan hindered us.
  19˚For what is our hope
       or joy
       or crown of boasting
       before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
       Is it not you?
    20˚For you are our glory and joy.

1˚Therefore
    when we could bear it no longer,
    we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone,
  2˚and we sent Timothy,
      our brother
      and God's coworker in the gospel of Christ,
    to establish
    and exhort you
      in your faith,
  3˚that no one be moved by these afflictions.
    For you yourselves know
      that we are destined for this.
  4˚For when we were with you,
      we kept telling you beforehand
      that we were to suffer affliction,
      just as it has come to pass,
      and just as you know.
5˚For this reason,
    when I could bear it no longer,
    I sent to learn about your faith,
    for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you
    and our labor would be in vain.
