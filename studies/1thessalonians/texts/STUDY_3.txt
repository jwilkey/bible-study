5˚You know what kind of men we proved to be
                                among you
                                for your sake.
6˚And you became imitators of us
                       and of the Lord,
    for you received the word in much affliction,
            with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
    7˚so that you became an example
                            to all the believers
                                       in Macedonia
                                   and in Achaia.
8˚For
    not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth
                                      from you
                                      in Macedonia
                                      and Achaia,
    but your faith in God
             has gone forth everywhere,
                 so that we need not say anything.
      9˚For they themselves report concerning us
          the kind of reception we had among you,
          and how you turned to God from idols
          to serve the living and true God,
       10˚and to wait for his Son from heaven,
            whom he raised from the dead,
            Jesus who delivers us
                      from the wrath to come.
