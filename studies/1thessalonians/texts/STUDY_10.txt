9˚Now
  concerning brotherly love
    you have no need for anyone to write to you,
    for you yourselves have been taught by God
                                 to love one another,
10˚for that indeed is what you are doing
     to all the brothers
                throughout Macedonia.
   But we urge you, brothers,
       to do this more and more,
    11˚and to aspire to live quietly,
       and to mind your own affairs,
       and to work with your hands,
       as we instructed you,
       12˚so that you may walk properly before outsiders
          and be dependent on no one.
