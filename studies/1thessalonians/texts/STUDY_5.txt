9˚For you remember,
      brothers,
          our labor and toil:
              we worked night and day,
              that we might not be a burden to any of you,
          while we proclaimed to you
                   the gospel of God.
10˚You are witnesses,
   and God also,
           how holy
           and righteous
           and blameless
           was our conduct toward you believers.
   11˚For you know how,
        like a father with his children,
         12˚we exhorted each one of you
           and encouraged you
           and charged you
               to walk in a manner worthy of God,
                  who calls you into his own kingdom
                                         and glory.
