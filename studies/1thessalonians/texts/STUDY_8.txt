6˚But now that Timothy has come to us from you,
    and has brought us the good news of your faith
                                         and love
    and reported that you always remember us kindly
                      and long to see us,
                    as we long to see you—
  7˚for this reason, brothers,
      in all our distress and affliction
      we have been comforted about you
        through your faith.
  8˚For now we live,
      if you are standing fast in the Lord.
  9˚For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you,
      for all the joy that we feel
                              for your sake
                              before our God,
   10˚as we pray most earnestly
            night and day
            that we may see you face to face
            and supply what is lacking in your faith?
˙
11˚Now may our God and Father himself,
       and our Lord Jesus,
     direct our way to you,
12˚and may the Lord make you increase
                         and abound
                          in love for one another
                              and for all,
                               as we do for you,
  13˚so that he may establish your hearts
                    blameless in holiness
                    before our God and Father,
                    at the coming of our Lord Jesus
                           with all his saints.
