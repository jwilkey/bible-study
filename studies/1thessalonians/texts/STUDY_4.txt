1˚For you yourselves know,
      brothers,
    that our coming to you was not in vain.
2˚But though we had already suffered
      and been shamefully treated at Philippi,
          as you know,
      we had boldness in our God
             to declare to you the gospel of God
             in the midst of much conflict.
3˚For our appeal does not spring from error
                                   or impurity
                                   or any attempt to deceive,
        4˚but just as we have been approved by God
                             to be entrusted with the gospel,
                                so we speak,
                                   not to please man,
                                   but to please God
                                       who tests our hearts.
        5˚For we never came with words of flattery,
                       as you know,
                        nor with a pretext for greed—
                       God is witness.
            6˚Nor did we seek glory from people,
                whether from you or from others,
                though we could have made demands
                          as apostles of Christ.
        7˚But we were gentle among you,
            like a nursing mother
              taking care of her own children.
8˚So,
  being affectionately desirous of you,
  we were ready to share with you
                   not only the gospel of God
                   but also our own selves,
          because you had become very dear to us.
