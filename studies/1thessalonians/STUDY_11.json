  "text": "13 But we do not want you to be uninformed,\n     brothers,\n     about those who are asleep,\n     that you may not grieve as others do\n       who have no hope.\n14 For since we believe that Jesus died\n       and rose again,\n     even so,\n       through Jesus,\n     God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.\n15 For this we declare to you\n       by a word from the Lord,\n     that we who are alive,\n     who are left\n       until the coming of the Lord,\n     will not precede those who have fallen asleep.\n16 For the Lord himself will descend\n       from heaven\n     with a cry of command,\n     with the voice of an archangel,\n     and with the sound of the trumpet of God.\n     And the dead in Christ will rise first.\n  17 Then we who are alive,\n       who are left,\n     will be caught up together with them\n       in the clouds\n     to meet the Lord in the air,\n     and so we will always be with the Lord.\n18 Therefore encourage one another\n     with these words.",
