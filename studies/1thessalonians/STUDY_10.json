In a realm where there is no rightful authority, no trusted voice, no good, there then is only pleasure, grasping at the magical glitter floating through the air, glitter that is in actuality the ashes of our self-inflaming.

He Himself will teach us how to love a love that will not consume like burning poison, that will not disappoint, that will not swallow us up in the grave forever.",

All things gained from a hand that is not our Father's are things that will decay and wither in time, and the pleasure gained from them now will hollow us out like wood rot. Instead, we can mind the affairs which our King has given us to mind, and do well with them. Likewise, let us work with the body that we have been given, exert ourselves for the good of those before us instead of demanding good from them. They of themselves cannot supply us. When we greedily demand love or material from the supposed privileged, we expect to gain life from places which cannot rightly supply it. Even if we win that argument, that riot, we still lose; we gain perhaps one piece of the puzzle. The things are never enough.",
