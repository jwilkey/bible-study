This is perhaps good advice if you are trying to take advantage of someone or if you are a greedy reprobate, but this is the opposite strategy of how Paul and friends took the gospel to the Thessalonians. It would appear that this audience was not Jewish and probably had much less familiarity with the ways of the true God, so it seems very good that Paul would have no thing get in the way of them and Jesus.`,
