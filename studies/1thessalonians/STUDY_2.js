        comment: `Oh mindless butterfly fluttering among the waves of man wrought progress! Such progress and ambition is like a hyper-spasmodic body, you have no idea what it will punch or shatter in it's uncontrolled randomness. Such ambition will leave one reaching the end of the season with nothing to remember, no gratefulness, no satisfaction, no belonging. But we belong to God and with one another. We love and enjoy our King and the people He has given us. He is deserving of our vocal and spiritual thanks.`,

        comment: `Puff, puff, puff you up, gently down the stream; merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream that fizzles away in a sudden realization that we have been holding a dark bag over our heads and breathing in our own hot air. The gospel comes in word, not in any word, but the authoritative testimony of Christ and the Spirit, and in the power of the One who powerfully forged the universe, and with full conviction set upon the trustworthiness of the Rock.`,

Well good for you, but Paul was the kind of man that helped others and brought them the message of life eternal. We are fools to the world, but Christ is the power of God!`,
