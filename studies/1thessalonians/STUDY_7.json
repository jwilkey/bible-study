  "text": "17˚But since we were torn away from you, brothers,\n     for a short time,\n     in person not in heart,\n     we endeavored the more eagerly\n       and with great desire\n     to see you face to face,\n  18˚because we wanted to come to you—\n       I, Paul, again and again—\n     but Satan hindered us.\n  19˚For what is our hope\n       or joy\n       or crown of boasting\n       before our Lord Jesus at his coming?\n       Is it not you?\n    20˚For you are our glory and joy.\n˙\n1˚Therefore\n    when we could bear it no longer,\n    we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone,\n  2˚and we sent Timothy,\n      our brother\n      and God's coworker in the gospel of Christ,\n    to establish\n    and exhort you\n      in your faith,\n  3˚that no one be moved by these afflictions.\n    For you yourselves know\n      that we are destined for this.\n  4˚For when we were with you,\n      we kept telling you beforehand\n      that we were to suffer affliction,\n      just as it has come to pass,\n      and just as you know.\n5˚For this reason,\n    when I could bear it no longer,\n    I sent to learn about your faith,\n    for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you\n    and our labor would be in vain.",
